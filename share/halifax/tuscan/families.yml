# This is a simple family that consists of a single 3200mm (10' 6") high Tuscan
# order column
#
# This column would be difficult to stretch vertically to provide a range of
# heights. One possibility would be to add a plinth at the bottom to make it
# taller. Another possibility would be to use a taller order that suits
# the same entablature, such as Ionic.
