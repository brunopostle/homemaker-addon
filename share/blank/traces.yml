# Traces are linear items
#
# 'exterior' is defined in the parent style (where it draws a solid wall with
# windows and doors along the 'external' trace). Redefining it and setting
# party_wall triggers behaviour suitable for a party wall.

exterior:
  class: Wall
  ifc: IfcWall
  offset: -0.25
  condition: external
  party_wall: true

# 'column', 'external-beam' and 'external-open' are defined in the parent
# style. We don't want any of this as they make no sense on a party-wall trace.

column:
  condition: noop
external beam:
  condition: noop
external-open:
  condition: noop

# An outdoor space won't normally be given a wall, here we draw a solid party
# wall.

openwall:
  class: Wall
  ifc: IfcWall
  offset: -0.25
  condition: open
  party_wall: true
