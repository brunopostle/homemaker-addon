# 'default' style

This is the default style used if no style is specified.

IFC Types, Materials and Profiles are in the `library.ifc` file.  The `.yml`
files contain rules for implementing the style.

Subfolders represent further styles, each style inherits and extends from its
parent, so all styles inherit some aspects of this default style.
