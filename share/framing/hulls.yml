# Hulls are planar items

# 'pitched-roof' and 'flat-roof' are defined in the parent style (where solid
# slabs are drawn in the 'roof' and 'flat' hulls). Redefining them as
# IfcVirtualElement creates all the space boundaries etc.. but no geometry is
# drawn

# 'external-studs' is the 'external' wall hull sliced as a 'Grillage', the
# lines in the grillage are drawn with traces and the areas between the lines
# are drawn with hulls. As a top-level hull associated with a single
# CellComplex Face it will be aggregated into a wall and cut by windows and
# doors.

# 'ply-sheathing' is the 'external' wall hull drawn with a Covering material,
