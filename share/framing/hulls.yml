# Hulls are planar items
#
# 'pitched-roof' and 'flat-roof' are defined in the parent style (where solid
# slabs are drawn in the 'roof' and 'flat' hulls). Redefining them as
# IfcVirtualElement creates all the space boundaries etc.. but no geometry is
# drawn

# 'external-studs' is the 'external' wall hull sliced as a 'Grillage', the
