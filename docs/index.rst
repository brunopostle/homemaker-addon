Homemaker add-on
================

*Design buildings the pointy-clicky way*

The `Homemaker add-on`_ tries to automate the tedious work of designing
buildings.  Just indicate with simple geometry where you want walls, floors and
roofs, and the software figures-out what building elements are needed to create
that building. The result is an industry-standard IFC (BIM) model, suitable for
taking the project towards construction.
